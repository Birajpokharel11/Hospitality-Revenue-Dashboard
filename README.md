## Key Metrics and Calculations

### Total Revenue Realized
- Formula: SUM(fact_bookings[revenue_realized])

### Total Number of Bookings
- Formula: COUNT(fact_bookings[booking_id])

### Total Capacity of Rooms
- Formula: SUM(fact_aggregated_bookings[capacity])

### Total Successful Bookings
- Formula: SUM(fact_aggregated_bookings[successful_bookings])

### Occupancy Percentage
- Formula: DIVIDE([Total Successful Bookings],[Total Capacity],0)

### Average Ratings Given by Customers
- Formula: AVERAGE(fact_bookings[ratings_given])

### Number of Days in Data
- Formula: DATEDIFF(MIN(dim_date[date]),MAX(dim_date[date]),DAY) +1

### Total Cancelled Bookings
- Formula: CALCULATE([Total Bookings],fact_bookings[booking_status]="Cancelled")

### Cancellation Percentage
- Formula: DIVIDE([Total cancelled bookings],[Total Bookings])

### Total Checked Out Bookings
- Formula: CALCULATE([Total Bookings],fact_bookings[booking_status]="Checked Out")

### Total No Show Bookings
- Formula: CALCULATE([Total Bookings],fact_bookings[booking_status]="No Show")

### No Show Rate Percentage
- Formula: DIVIDE([Total no show bookings],[Total Bookings])

### Booking Percentage by Platform
- Formula: DIVIDE([Total Bookings], CALCULATE([Total Bookings], ALL(fact_bookings[booking_platform])))*100

### Booking Percentage by Room Class
- Formula: DIVIDE([Total Bookings], CALCULATE([Total Bookings], ALL(dim_rooms[room_class])))*100

### ADR (Average Daily Rate)
- Formula: DIVIDE( [Revenue], [Total Bookings],0)

### Realization Percentage
- Formula: 1- ([Cancellation %]+[No Show rate %])

### RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room)
- Formula: DIVIDE([Revenue],[Total Capacity])

### DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights)
- Formula: DIVIDE([Total Bookings], [No of days])

### DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights)

### DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights)
- Formula: DIVIDE([Total Checked Out],[No of days])

### Week-over-Week Changes
- Formula: See individual formulas for Revenue, Occupancy, ADR, RevPAR, Realization, and DSRN.
